# F4S Standard Operating Procedure: Prospector Mining (v1.1)

**DOCUMENT ID:** SOP-SEN-MIN-PROSPECTOR-v1.1
**CLEARANCE:** F4S Level 3
**GAME VERSION:** Star Citizen 4.5

---

## 1. OVERVIEW

This document provides the official Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for all mining operations utilizing the MISC Prospector. It covers logistics, loadouts, strategy, execution, and emergency procedures. Adherence to this SOP is mandatory for all F4S Sentinel Division operators to ensure maximum efficiency, profitability, and safety.

## 2. ACQUISITION & LOGISTICS

A fully-equipped Prospector requires components from four separate locations. This route is optimized for efficiency.

| Stop | Location                  | Items to Acquire                                      |
| :--- | :------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | **Platinum Bay** (HUR-L5) | Atlas Quantum Drive, JS-300 Power Plant               |
| 2    | **CenterMass** (Area18)   | FR-66 Shield Generator, Zero-Rush Cooler              |
| 3    | **Shubin Interstellar** (New Babbage) | Helix I (Top-Tier) or Arbor MH1 (Budget) Mining Head |
| 4    | **Refinery Deck** (HUR-L1)  | OptiMax/BoreMax Modules, Surge/Stampede Gadgets       |

## 3. OPTIMIZED LOADOUTS

Two official loadouts are approved for Prospector operations.

### A. Budget Setup (Max Effectiveness)
- **Purpose:** All-purpose mining, ideal for new operators.
- **Mining Head:** Arbor MH1
- **Modules:** BoreMax
- **Profitability:** ~60-80k aUEC/hr (Mixed Ores)

### B. Top-Tier Setup (Max Profit)
- **Purpose:** Specializes in high-value Quantanium and Taranite.
- **Mining Head:** Helix I
- **Modules:** OptiMax, BoreMax
- **Profitability:** ~100-150k aUEC/hr (Quantanium)

## 4. ORE SELECTION FRAMEWORK

Profit is determined by rock selection. Follow these rules without deviation.

| Metric                | Mine Condition                                      | Skip Condition                                      |
| :-------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scan Return**       | Bright, stable blip >8km away                       | Faint, flickering blip <4km away                    |
| **Rock Mass**         | 4,000 - 7,500 tons                                  | <2,000 tons or >10,000 tons                       |
| **Quantanium %**      | &ge;30% (single) or &ge;25% (cluster)                | <20%                                                |
| **Other Minerals**    | Taranite/Hadanite &ge;25%, Bexalite &ge;20%           | Below these thresholds                              |
| **Fracture Difficulty** | Manageable instability, stable green window         | Uncontrollable instability, collapsing window       |
| **Quantanium Timer**  | **25-minute hard limit.** Target 60-80% fill and return. | Greed is not an acceptable risk factor.             |

## 5. PROFICIENCY PATHWAY

- **Beginner:** Operate in **Lyria (Stanton)**. Focus on process and safety. Target common ores.
- **Intermediate:** Operate in **Yela Belt (Stanton)**. Focus on efficiency and mid-tier ores.
- **Advanced:** Operate in **Bloom/Terminus (Pyro)**. Focus on maximum profit and survival. Target Quantanium.

## 6. EXECUTION DOCTRINE

1.  **Prospecting:** Scan and identify viable targets based on the framework.
2.  **Fracturing:** Manage laser power and instability to break the rock.
3.  **Extraction:** Vacuum valuable ore fragments. **The Quantanium timer starts now.**
4.  **Refinement:** Immediately travel to the nearest refinery, store the ship, and start a refining job.

## 7. TROUBLESHOOTING

- **Insufficient Power:** Rock resistance is too high. Use OptiMax module or Surge gadget. If it fails, abandon the rock.
- **High Instability:** Rock is too volatile. Use Stampede gadget. If it fails, abandon the rock.
- **Timer Critical:** If Quantanium timer is low, immediately RTB (Return to Base). Eject cargo if necessary to save the ship.
- **Overheating:** Your cooler is insufficient or damaged. Mine in short bursts and divert power to coolers.
